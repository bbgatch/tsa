The `tsa-data.py` code automates the process of pulling data from the TSA website. The TSA began publishing traveler numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic to help monitor the impact on air travel.

The `revision-check.py` code checks for any revisions in prior daily data. The TSA website notes that past data can be periodically updated. This code could be further updated to be more flexible.
